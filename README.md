# "See Her" React.js Website

Welcome to the "See Her" React.js website repository. This project is an interactive website aimed at shedding light on the flaws in the South African police justice system through a chatbot experience. Users can engage with the chatbot to gain insights into the challenges faced by individuals seeking assistance or reporting incidents. Additionally, symbolic visuals and victim stories are provided to serve as a poignant reminder of the broken aspects of the system. Our mission is to raise awareness and work towards positive change.
