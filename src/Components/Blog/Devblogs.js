DEV BLOG 8 -IMPORTANCE OF DESIGN


RECAP 

Title: The Power of Design: Lessons from the Recap Video

Introduction:

Design holds immense influence over our interactions with the physical and digital world. In an engaging recap video, we delve into the vital role of design, using a captivating story about a peculiar door on the 10th floor of the Fox Media office. This door, known as a Norman door, has caused confusion among employees due to its unclear usability. The video introduces the concept of Norman doors, named after the renowned design expert Don Norman, which are doors that confuse people because they don't work the way they appear. This blog post explores the key ideas from the recap video, highlighting the importance of effective design and discoverability.

The Norman Door and Usability Signals:

A Norman door, coined by Don Norman, refers to a door that perplexes users because its design doesn't match its functionality. These doors give the wrong signals, leading people to push when they should pull or vice versa. To address this confusion, special signs are required to clarify how the door should be used. The Norman door exemplifies the idea that good design should clearly communicate how something should be used without the need for extra labels or instructions. When design fails to do this, it causes frustration and disrupts the user experience.

Design Done Right:

Don Norman emphasizes in the video the importance of well-executed design. When design is carefully thought out, it eliminates the need for explicit explanations or labels. By focusing on user-centered design, a well-designed object should guide users naturally, making the process easy and intuitive. In the case of the Norman door, a well-designed door would remove the need for signs telling users whether to push or pull. Instead, it would provide visual cues that match users' expectations, resulting in a smooth and frustration-free experience.

Discoverability Law: Improving User Experience:

The recap video introduces the interesting concept of the discoverability law. In the context of product and interface design, discoverability refers to how easily users can find and understand all the features of a new system when they first encounter it. Designers who prioritize discoverability minimize the learning curve and empower users to explore and utilize the system effortlessly. By ensuring that important features are easy to discover, designers enhance the user experience, creating a sense of engagement and satisfaction.

The Role of Feedback in Design:

Don Norman concludes the video by highlighting the role of feedback in well-designed objects. Effective design not only indicates whether an action has taken place but also provides insight into why it happened. Furthermore, a successful design makes the interaction so smooth that users aren't even aware they've interacted with an object. By offering helpful feedback and enabling seamless interaction, designers establish a harmonious relationship between users and their environment, ultimately enhancing the overall experience.

Conclusion:

The recap video serves as a valuable reminder of the indispensable role of design in our daily lives. Through the concept of the Norman door and the importance of discoverability, viewers are encouraged to reflect on the significance of effective design in creating intuitive and engaging experiences. By embracing user-centered design principles and striving for clarity and feedback, designers can create solutions that seamlessly integrate into users' lives, fostering positive and effortless interaction between humans and their environment.

Week 9 Reflection: Exploring React.js Libraries, Components, and Coding Perspectives


In Week 9’s lecture, we delved into the world of React.js libraries and discovered the immense value of components in building dynamic web applications. Along the way, we also explored naming conventions for different file types like .js and .css, which brought clarity and organization to our projects.


One concept that particularly caught my attention was the use of React.Fragment instead of the traditional div element. React.Fragment allows us to group elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. This not only improves the performance of our applications but also results in cleaner code.

During the course, we also learned some handy shortcuts that significantly speed up coding. One of my favorites is the "Ctrl D" shortcut, which highlights multiple occurrences of a selected word, allowing for quick changes across the codebase. These shortcuts are small but mighty, enhancing our productivity and making coding a breeze.

We also explored using Unsplash for sourcing images and learned the importance of crediting the creators. By incorporating high-quality images into our projects, we can elevate the overall user experience. To streamline the process, we were encouraged to declare a constant image URL at the top of our code, ensuring consistency and easy modification in the future.

<p>What truly transformed my perspective during this week was the shift in my approach to wireframing and design. Instead of merely envisioning layouts and visual elements, I now think of them as individual components and consider the underlying code structure while designing. This new mindset has not only improved the efficiency of my development process but has also empowered me to create more scalable and maintainable code.

The 2022 Dev Conference titled "HOW WE CODE MATTERS" by Hanli Geyser shed light on various aspects of coding, such as ways of thinking, the influence of epistemology on our thought processes, and the notion of code as a form of literacy. I found it fascinating to draw parallels between learning programming languages and acquiring skills to reading and writing in English. It reinforced the idea that coding is not merely a technical skill but a form of expression and problem-solving that requires critical thinking and creativity.

To wrap it up, Week 9 has been an eye-opening journey into the world of React.js libraries, components, and coding perspectives. The course equipped me with practical tools, shortcuts, and naming conventions that enhance the efficiency and organization of my code. Lastly, the insightful talk by Hanli Geyser reminded me of the deeper significance of coding as a form of literacy and the influence of our thought processes in shaping our code.

I can't wait to see what the next week’s class holds in store for me as I continue to expand my skills and learn more and create using React.js.

Week 10

Code Art: Intersection of Creativity and Technology


In the world of digital innovation, a fascinating question arises: Is Code Art? This week's course material delves deep into this intriguing topic, exploring the intricate relationship between art and code. We will explore the historical context, philosophical perspectives, and the profound impact of coding as a creative medium. Join us on this captivating journey as we unravel the essence of code as an art form.


To understand the connection between art and code, we must first recognize the intertwined nature of creativity and technology. Throughout history, art has served as a medium of expression, while code has enabled us to harness the power of technology. The fusion of these two realms has given rise to an entirely new artistic landscape.

Drawing inspiration from Greek aesthetics, we find that the concept of art as imitation and the pursuit of beauty are intimately linked with virtue. Artistic expression has always sought to encapsulate the human experience and evoke emotions. Similarly, code, as a creative tool, has the potential to capture and recreate the essence of our existence in a digital realm.

One of the defining characteristics of art is its claim to universality. When we deem something beautiful, we inherently desire others to share our perceptions. Renaissance aesthetics emphasized the pursuit of beauty as a fundamental aspect of art. In this light, we can argue that code, with its capacity for creating visually stunning and aesthetically pleasing digital experiences, aligns with the quest for beauty in art.


Art often transcends practicality and serves a purpose beyond its tangible function. Similarly, code is a medium that enables us to manifest purposeful expressions. It allows us to sculpt digital landscapes, build interactive experiences, and bring our creative visions to life. Code empowers artists and creators to manipulate technology, transforming it into a canvas upon which they can paint their imagination.

Taking all these elements into consideration, it becomes evident that code can indeed be considered art. Code merges the realms of creativity and technology, enabling us to express ourselves, evoke emotions, and create beauty in the digital landscape. Just as a sculptor shapes clay or a painter wields a brush, a coder crafts intricate algorithms and weaves lines of code to produce captivating digital masterpieces.

React Props


In this week's React lecture, a few key points stuck out to me and helped me on my React learning path. These key points will be shared in this blog article below.

Less reading and more doing: 


I was able to improve my comprehension and bridge the gap between theory and practice by coding alongside class videos. This method provided me with practical experience while reinforcing the topics and tactics discussed in the lecture. 


The presentation emphasized the significance of organizing distinct components under the src folder. These components are then combined into the main App.js component, which serves as the primary component. Finally, the index.js component file renders the App component, which is then shown in the index.html file.



The lecture's step-by-step explanation of this workflow made it easier for me to understand how to make useable components:

Importing: To start, import any additional essential imports as well as any dependencies, such as React from React. 

Component definition: To define a component that extends the React Component class, use the class keyword. 

Implement the render function in the component class, which returns the JSX code outlining the component's structure. 

Finish the component definition by exporting it so that it may be used elsewhere in the application.




The assignment for this week helped me understand React by presenting key concepts like component composition, prop passing, and dynamic content rendering. I was able to create React components with confidence by using this methodical technique, which helped me understand how to create components.

Week 11


Understanding React States: 

In this week's lecture on React, the focus was on states and their significance in developing dynamic user interfaces. States play a crucial role in managing changing conditions within the client interface, allowing for interactive and responsive web applications. This blog post summarizes the key points covered in the lecture.

 What is State? 

The concept of state in React refers to the dynamic condition of the client interface, which may differ from the state on the server. The state enables the user interface to respond to events and constantly adapt based on user interactions.

Examples of state in web applications include different screens for logged-in and logged-out users, pop-up modal windows, and expandable or collapsible sections. 





Understanding the Nature of State: 
To understand the nature of the state, this week’s lecture made examples of games, such as chess, where the board is in a complex state at any given moment. Similarly, the state of a web application constantly changes in response to various events and user actions. 

What Does State Track?

State in React serves two primary purposes: 

UI logic: State tracks the changing state of the interface, such as the visibility of a modal window when editing a user profile.

Business logic: The state monitors the changing state of data, such as marking messages as read or unread, which affects their display in an inbox.

Week 12 : 

AI and ART


Artificial intelligence (AI) has had an influence on our lives, and the arts are no exception. In this blog, I'll discuss the important takeaways from the readings that I was able to complete.


"Can Artificial Intelligence Make Art Without Artists? Ask the Viewer" by Audry and Ippolito (2019):

According to Audry and Ippolito, AI-generated art is not only the output of algorithms but also of the viewer's perception and interaction. They highlight the importance of the human element in the creative experience, arguing that AI art should be viewed as a collaborative effort between machine and audience. 



"The Machine as Artist as Myth" by Broeckmann (2019): 

In his investigation of how people regard robots as artists, Broeckmann looks at historical and cultural factors. He explores the myths surrounding the creativity of computers and disputes the idea that they may completely replace human artists. Broeckmann draws attention to the uniqueness of human artistic expression and the shortcomings of technology in simulating it.



"Art, Creativity, and the Potential of Artificial Intelligence" by Mazzone and Elgammal (2019): 

Mazzone and Elgammal look at how AI could enhance artistic potential and increase human creativity. They talk about how AI algorithms are integrated into the creative process and how it affects the art market. The authors argue that rather than taking the place of human creative thinking, AI might serve as a catalyst for it.
