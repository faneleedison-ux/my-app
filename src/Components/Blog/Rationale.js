        Rationale My website's "Art" section features a powerful digital artwork
        called "SEE HER" which is inspired by the Instagram page
        "@keepthesameenergy," dedicated to reporting on the gender-based
        violence crisis in South Africa. This artwork showcases a series of eyes
        that follow the user's cursor, creating an eerie and unsettling feeling
        that parallels the constant feeling of being watched that many women in
        South Africa experience due to gender-based violence. About My Art: "SEE
        HER" is a tribute to the countless South African women who have fallen
        victim to gender-based violence over the years. It seeks to raise
        awareness about the constant fear and uncertainty that women face in
        South Africa as they go about their daily lives, always wondering if
        they will be the next victim. Through this artwork, we hope to create a
        platform for dialogue and action towards ending gender-based violence.
        What I Want The Audience To Experience: My intention with this artwork
        is to give our audience a visceral experience of what it's like to be
        constantly under surveillance, as many women in South Africa are. I want
        the viewer to feel a sense of fear and unease as the eyes follow their
        cursor around the screen, mimicking the feeling of constantly being
        watched. This artwork is meant to serve as a reminder of the urgent need
        for action to address gender-based violence and to make our society a
        safer and more equitable place for all. How it relates to other internet
        artworks: The website was inspired by a 2014 film called “A Girl Walks
        Alone At Night'' directed by Ana Lily Amirpour. The film follows a young
        female vampire that watches over females in an Iranian city called “bad
        city” (see figure 1.1), the vampire preys on immoral men in the film so
        that she can defend the female inhabitants of Bad City from the
        patriarchal violence (Shadee and Bernadette, 2017). The female vampire
        walks around at night making sure that the females in the city are safe
        and avenges their perpetrators by sucking their blood. The theme of the
        black and white film: is “a girl walking alone at night” and that
        feeling of uneasiness in the film was incorporated into the web art by
        using pitch-black background along with the images of the gender-based
        violence victim to invoke the feeling of fear to the website visitor.
        Figure 1.1 A Scene From A Girl Walks Alone At Night (2014) The website
        aims to, just for a few minutes, make the visitor feel like they are a
        female walking alone at night in one of the unsafe country like South
        Africa. My internet art relates to other works of internet art like Olia
        Lialina's 1996 artwork “My Boyfriend Came Back from the War” (Figure
        1.2) because it is a narrative-driven form of artwork. Lialina's
        internet art mainly follows a young woman and her boyfriend as they
        reunite after his return from the World War and tells a story about her
        affair while he was away (Coleman, 2015).In comparing and contrasting
        cinema and the web as creative and popular media, “My Boyfriend Came
        Back from the War'' emphasises the use of browser frames, hypertext, and
        graphics (both animated and motionless(Kerr, 2015. Lialina employs the
        internet to question our beliefs about how memories are formed and
        organised (Coleman, 2015). Figure 1.2 Lialina’s 1996 “My Boyfriend Came
        Back from the War” internet art. Photo Credit: Franz Wamhoff. How The
        Internet Art Reflects The Theory: During the semester we learned about
        three fundamental principles that make internet art most functional and
        most interactive with the user or “visitor” and those are as follows:
        Design principles, Functionality and Aesthetics. According to Park, for
        web designers to achieve the user-centred design they must follow these
        design principles (Park, 2007, pg. 1): Invisible design elements I made
        use of code to make the designed elements functional and so that the
        user is able to navigate the website well. Collaborative participation I
        used many online platforms such as Stackoverflow, and YouTube including
        the class’s WhatsApp group to ask any questions that I had. Anarchic
        structure For effective coding, I used visual studio programming in
        order to ensure that all my work is saved offline and continuous testing
        is done to check if the code is showing the visual effects and functions
        that I had intended for it to do. Non-linear communication

        My netart is not a time-based form of narrative that has a beginning and
        an end, the visitor can interact with it as long as they like. According
        to Thorlacius, there are 4 main areas of aesthetics in design, and “the
        most successful Web sites are therefore the sites where the Web designer
        has created the aesthetic aspects in accordance with the four
        below-mentioned areas” (Thorlacius, 2007, pg 67) : Support the Content
        and Functionality Appeal to the Audience Sender Image Supporting Genre 1
        Each “tab” of the website is able to support the content and
        functionality of its respective aim, each tab on the website is designed
        to give the user key information about the internet art, how it was made
        and the logic behind it. 2 The aesthetic effects support the content and
        the functional aspects, the website has a menu tab and icons that
        indicate to the user how they can navigate the site. 3 The aesthetic
        effects were adapted to the genre of the Website. The use of “folders”
        in other sections of the site to represent police case folders for women
        who are victims of Gender-Based Violence was used in order to fit the
        genre of the website which is “the fight against GBV in SA”. 4 The
        aesthetic effects were adapted to the target audience. Because the
        website is target a young audience that are fans of modern and digital
        artworks, the site was therefore designed in accordance with the modern
        trends in visual aesthetics. The use of popping colours such as “pink”,
        and employing minimalism ensure that the user is able to instinctively
        and seamlessly navigate the website without any need for help because
        the same navigation functions are used in other social sites.
        Functionality My internet art made use of the following languages within
        the react app to create a more aesthetically pleasing and more
        functional website that is user-friendly. CSS, HTML, and JAVASCRIPT. How
        The Internet Art Integrates With The Rest Of The Site: The internet art
        integrates with the rest of the site because the blog section along with
        the design section has folders that are clickable and take the user to
        the respective link. The use of “folders” on other sections of the
        website is representative of the case folders that are used in the
        police station to open the GBV case, the folders are pink because “pink”
        has become a colour to represent GBV in SA. The "keep the same energy"
        campaign uses the colour pink as a unifying theme across all of its
        social media platforms to symbolise a better future free from violence
        against women and girls. Reflection In this section I will reflect on my
        internet artwork based on two categories: Success (where does internet
        artwork succeed, how and WHY) Failure (where does internet artwork fail,
        how and WHY) Success Aesthetics & Functionality Navigation on the
        website is seamless, and the web art is fully functional and has a
        meaningful storyline that also integrates with the rest of the website.
        All the embedded links and icons redirect the user to the correct
        respect websites. The website is also very responsive. Failure The final
        website failed implement the geolocation like
        https://crimecheck.news24.com/ and failed to implement the tinder card
        system which contained stories of the victims and their information.
