        “I wondered, 'What would I want from a poem in the desert? Would I want
        a poem there at all?'” – Amy Sara Carroll.

        The Electronic Disturbance Theatre (EDT) created the Transborder
        Immigrant Tool (TBT), a smartphone application that guides individuals
        crossing the US-Mexico border across the deserts and waterways,
        providing them with directions to water stops and emotional support
        through poetry. The software was created to provide direct assistance to
        immigrants while also challenging official institutions. TBT is an
        important initiative because it blends poetry with coding and blurs the
        border between activism and creative practice. I will critically
        evaluate TBT from a conceptual, aesthetic, and technical standpoint in
        this analysis, building on the insights of Carrier (2020), Danae (2019),
        Bishop (2012), and Bisschoff (2017). TBT presents crucial conceptual
        questions about migration, boundaries, and human rights. The project
        challenges the government's immigration policy by offering direct
        assistance to individuals crossing the US-Mexico border. The app's goal
        is to assist people in navigating the tough circumstances of the desert
        and water on their approach to the United States. TBT directly fights
        the government's efforts to prosecute immigrants by offering information
        about water stations and mental assistance through poetry. According to
        Carrier (2020), "technology has not only expanded the terrain of art,
        but it has also transformed the conditions of social engagement,
        presenting new possibilities for public intervention." TBT highlights
        the role of technology in activism by demonstrating how it may be
        utilised as a tool for social and political action. TBT is an aesthetic
        combination of activism and art. The application blends coding, poetry,
        and navigation tools to produce a one-of-a-kind and innovative project
        that challenges conventional assumptions of what constitutes art. The
        project's goal is to be simple to use, accessible, and visually
        appealing. The app's layout is visually appealing, and the poetry gives
        emotional and mental support to newcomers. According to Danae (2019),
        "post-internet art is less concerned with creating beautiful objects and
        more focused on creating experiences, engaging the viewer, and changing
        the way people perceive the world." TBT is a fantastic illustration of
        how art can engage the audience and challenge standard ways of thinking
        about social and political concerns.

        Technically speaking, TBT is a combination of poetry and code. Because
        it can combine features like GPS, water station locations, and poetry,
        the app has a complex technical architecture. The Electronic Disturbance
        Theatre (EDT) created the app using open-source software, making it
        available to anybody with a smartphone. The app's code is freely
        accessible, allowing other developers to expand on the work of the EDT.
        "The future is digital," writes Bisschoff (2017), "and digital
        technologies are transforming the way we create and consume art." TBT
        teaches how to use digital technology to produce socially and
        politically involved artworks that defy conventional concepts of art and
        activism. TBT is a notable initiative that addresses critical issues of
        migration, borders, and human rights and is the reason why I chose it as
        my focus area for my analysis. The initiative emphasises the role of
        technology in activism and questions conventional assumptions of what
        constitutes art. The capacity of the app to mix many capabilities such
        as GPS, water station locations, and poetry is an outstanding
        illustration of how digital technology can be utilised to produce new
        and socially relevant artworks. The technical complexity of the project
        stems from its capacity to mix several capabilities, highlighting the
        power of open-source software and digital technology to change the way
        we produce and consume art.

        Moreover, TBT is a project that challenges the traditional boundaries
        between art and activism. The app is not only a tool for providing
        information and support to immigrants, but it is also a work of art that
        creates experiences that engage with the viewer. The combination of
        navigation tools, poetry, and illustrations creates an immersive
        experience that challenges traditional notions of art and activism. As
        Bishop (2012) argues, "The key to understanding digital art is not to
        focus on the medium itself but on the social, cultural, and political
        context in which it operates." TBT demonstrates how digital art can
        operate in a social, cultural, and political context, highlighting the
        role of art in shaping public discourse. TBT also raises important
        ethical issues related to the use of technology for activism. The app's
        ability to provide information and support to immigrants raises
        questions about the role of technology in promoting social and political
        change. As Carrier (2020) argues, "The relationship between art and
        activism has always been fraught with ethical challenges, from the use
        of violence to the exploitation of vulnerable populations." TBT raises
        important questions about the ethical use of technology in activism,
        highlighting the need for artists and activists to consider the
        potential implications of their work. Transborder Immigrant Tool (TBT)
        demonstrates how the thoughtful application of design principles and
        psychological effects can help to create a mobile app that is both
        functional and emotionally resonant. By incorporating the following laws
        and principles into its design, TBT is able to provide critical support
        to immigrants navigating the harsh conditions of the US-Mexico
        borderlands.

        Fitt's Law: Fitt's Law states that the time required to reach a target
        is a function of the target's distance and size. In the case of TBT, the
        size of the buttons and icons on the mobile app are designed to be large
        enough to make it easy for users to tap them accurately, even while they
        are on the move. Hick's Law: Hick's Law states that the time it takes
        for a person to make a decision increases with the number of choices
        available. To address this, TBT provides a clear and simple interface
        that offers users only the essential information they need, without
        overwhelming them with extraneous details. This allows users to quickly
        make decisions about where to go and what to do. Von Restorff Effect:
        The Von Restorff Effect is a psychological principle that states that
        items that stand out from their surroundings are more likely to be
        remembered. TBT uses this effect by incorporating poetry into its
        interface, which helps to make it more memorable and emotionally
        resonant for its users. Zeigarnik Effect: The Zeigarnik Effect is a
        psychological principle that states that people remember unfinished or
        interrupted tasks better than completed ones. TBT uses this effect by
        providing users with a checklist of water stations and other resources
        that they need to access along their journey. This not only helps users
        keep track of their progress, but it also provides a sense of
        accomplishment as they check off each item on the list. Serial Position
        Effect: The Serial Position Effect is a psychological principle that
        states that people are more likely to remember items at the beginning
        and end of a list than those in the middle. TBT uses this effect by
        placing the most important information at the beginning and end of each
        screen, such as the location of the nearest water station or the
        distance to the next checkpoint.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        Law of Locality: The Law of Locality states that items that are close
        together are perceived as a group, while those that are far apart are
        perceived as separate. TBT uses this law by grouping related information
        together on each screen, such as the distance to the next checkpoint and
        the estimated travel time. This makes it easier for users to quickly
        process and understand the information presented. UI Principles,
        Flexibility, and Hierarchy: TBT uses a number of user interface (UI)
        principles, such as visual hierarchy, flexibility, and consistency, to
        create a clear and intuitive interface that users can quickly understand
        and navigate. For example, TBT uses a consistent color scheme and
        typography throughout the app to create a sense of visual unity. It also
        employs a flexible layout that can adapt to different screen sizes and
        orientations, ensuring that the app is usable on a variety of devices.
        Additionally, TBT uses a clear visual hierarchy, with important
        information placed prominently on each screen and less important
        information presented in a smaller font or lower down on the screen. To
        summarise, The Transborder Immigrant Tool (TBT) is a creative and
        socially active artwork that questions conventional concepts of art and
        activism. The capacity of the app to integrate navigation tools, poetry,
        and drawings produces an immersive experience that engages the spectator
        while highlighting crucial concerns including migration, borders, and
        human rights. TBT teaches how to use digital technology to produce
        socially and politically involved artworks that defy conventional
        concepts of art and activism. The project emphasises crucial ethical
        problems with the use of technology for activism, emphasising the need
        of artists and activists considering the potential consequences of their
        work.TBT is a great example of how art and technology can be merged to
        produce unique and socially relevant artworks that create and contribute
        to the public conversation.
