        Gender-based violence (GBV) is a widespread problem that affects
        millions of individuals throughout the world. Many organisations and
        individuals have turned to websites to raise awareness and provide
        resources for survivors in the fight against GBV. When it comes to
        fostering interaction and engagement, however, not all websites are made
        equal. This essay will look at various ways to improve website
        interaction in order to provide a more interesting and effective
        platform for tackling GBV.

        Storytelling is one approach for increasing website involvement.
        According to research, storytelling may be an effective technique to
        engage users and foster empathy (Graesser et al., 2018). Visitors can
        identify emotionally with the situation and be encouraged to take action
        by including victim stories on the website. Furthermore, allowing users
        to share their own stories can foster a sense of community and encourage
        further engagement.

        Another strategy is to make use of interactive features such as quizzes,
        surveys, and games. These features not only make the website more
        engaging but can also provide valuable information and feedback to the
        user. For example, a quiz could test the user's knowledge of GBV and
        provide them with resources based on their results. A survey could
        gather data on user experiences with GBV to inform future content and
        resources. Games could provide a more lighthearted approach to the issue
        while still promoting awareness and education.

        Incorporating social media into the website can also improve
        interactivity. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter
        provide an opportunity for users to engage with the website and share
        its content with their networks. Additionally, social media can be used
        to gather feedback and connect with users on a more personal level.

        To ensure that these strategies are effective, it is important to
        consider design principles such as Fitt's Law, Hick's Law, the Von
        Restorff Effect, the Zeigarnik Effect, the Serial Position Effect, and
        the Law of Locality. These principles can help to optimise the user
        experience and promote engagement by making the website easy to
        navigate, visually appealing, and memorable (Norman, 2013).

        Finally, a website may be changed from a static platform to an engaging
        and effective instrument for combating gender-based violence by adding
        narrative, interactive elements, social media, and design principles. We
        can inspire action and create a society free of violence and
        discrimination by developing an interactive website that engages people
        emotionally and intellectually.
